# data_structures_algo_1

An array is a data structure that organizes items sequentially. Each position in an array has an index. The first position in an array has an index of 0.

- To look up an item by index in an array is constant time (O(1).    
- Adding an item to an array is constant time (O(1)).
- In the worst case, inserting an item in an array is linear time (O(n)). When you insert into an array, all the items â€” starting at the index we are inserting into have to be shifted one index.
